# üí´ Scientific Python INcantations (`spin`)

## A developer tool for scientific Python libraries

**NOTE:** If you are looking for `devpy`, this is it! We had to rename
the package to publish it on PyPi.

Developers need to memorize a whole bunch of magic command-line incantations.
And these incantations change from time to time!
Typically, their lives are made simpler by a Makefile, but Makefiles can be convoluted, are not written in Python, and are hard to extend.
The rationale behind `spin` is therefore to provide a simple interface for common development tasks.
It comes with a few common build commands out the box, but can easily be customized per project.

As a curiosity: the impetus behind developing the tool was the mass migration of scientific Python libraries (SciPy, scikit-image, and NumPy, etc.) to Meson, after distutils was deprecated.
When many of the build and installation commands changed, it made sense to abstract away the nuisance of having to re-learn them.

## Installation

```
pip install spin
```

## Configuration

Settings are in your project's `pyproject.toml`.
As an example, see the `[tool.spin]` section of [an example `pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/scientific-python/spin/blob/main/example_pkg/pyproject.toml).

The `[tool.spin]` section should contain:

```
package = "pkg_importname"  # name of your package
commands = [
  "spin.cmds.meson.build",
  "spin.cmds.meson.test"
]
```

See [the command selection](#built-in-commands) below.

### Command sections

Once you have several commands, it may be useful to organize them into sections.
In `pyproject.toml`, instead of specifying the commands as a list, use the following structure:

```toml
[tool.spin.commands]
"Build" = [
  "spin.cmds.meson.build",
  "spin.cmds.meson.test"
]
"Environments" = [
  "spin.cmds.meson.shell",
  "spin.cmds.meson.ipython",
  "spin.cmds.meson.python"
]
```

These commands will then be rendered as:

```
Build:
  build  üîß Build package with Meson/ninja and install
  test   üîß Run tests

Environments:
  shell    üíª Launch shell with PYTHONPATH set
  ipython  üíª Launch IPython shell with PYTHONPATH set
  python   üêç Launch Python shell with PYTHONPATH set
```

## Running

```
spin
```

or

```
python -m spin
```

## Built-in commands

### [Meson](https://meson-python.readthedocs.io)

```
  build    üîß Build package with Meson/ninja and install to `build-install`
  ipython  üíª Launch IPython shell with PYTHONPATH set
  python   üêç Launch Python shell with PYTHONPATH set
  shell    üíª Launch shell with PYTHONPATH set
  test     üîß Run pytest
```

### [Build](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (PEP 517 builder)

`spin` was started with Meson in mind, but we're working on expanding commands for PEP 517 `build`.

```
  sdist    üì¶ Build a source distribution in `dist/`.
```

## üß™ Custom commands

`spin` can invoke custom commands. These commands define their own arguments, and have access to the `pyproject.toml` file for further configuration.

See, e.g., the [example custom command](https://github.com/scientific-python/spin/blob/main/example_pkg/.spin/cmds.py).

Add custom commands to the `commands` variable in the `[tool.spin]` section of `pyproject.toml` as follows:

```
commands = [..., '.spin/cmds.py:example']
```

Here, the command is stored in `.spin/cmds.py`, and the function
is named `example`.

### Configuration

Custom commands can access the `pyproject.toml` as follows:

```python
from spin import util


@click.command()
def example():
    """Command that accesses `pyproject.toml` configuration"""
    config = util.get_config()
    print(config["tool.spin"])
```

## History

The `dev.py` tool was [proposed for SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15489) by Ralf Gommers and [implemented](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/15959) by Sayantika Banik, Eduardo Naufel Schettino, and Ralf Gommers (also see [Sayantika's blog post](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/the-evolution-of-the-scipy-developer-cli)).
Inspired by that implementation, `spin` (this package) is a minimal rewrite by St√©fan van der Walt, that aims to be easily extendable so that it can be used across ecosystem libraries.
We thank Danila Bredikhin and Luca Marconato who kindly donated the `spin` name on PyPi.
